    My name is Jonathan Atikilt, and I am going into 10th grade at University Prepatory Academy. I enjoy playing many sports like basketball, football, and soccer. Along with those sports, I run a lot in the morning, even at the SMASH program. On the side, I watch anime non-stop, to the point where my parents tell me to stop. Overall, I believe that this website along with the rest of the Computer Science class will help me understand the importance of the internet. After all, computer science leads to a whole new fields in most aspects of life, and succeeding in that will give us an opportunity having a good life.
